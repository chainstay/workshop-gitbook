# Quick Disclaimers

## This workshop will ask you to install software

Within this material, you will be asked to make the following changes to your computer:

1. Install the Python programming language
2. Install two open-source Python software extensions
3. Run code written by the author of this workshop

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you choose not to make these changes to your computer, you will be unable to proceed with the workshop material.

As a programmer, I take software security very seriously. Everything I ask you to install is already installed on my personal and professional computers. You can safely proceed through this entire course without installing or running risky software. However, if you are still concerned I suggest you seek out a different workshop.
