# Start Here

## Some conventions

### Important terms

Important terms in computing will look `like this`. Pay attention to these words. If they are unfamiliar to you, look for them in the Glossary.

#### For example

* The student inserted the `SD Card` into the `USB` port.
* Plug your `ethernet` cable into the `router` to access the Internet.
* The cat walked across the `keyboard`

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}

### Code

This is code. You'll be seeing this a lot in today's workshop.

Notice the filename, in this case `filename.py`.

    print('Hello hacker. Welcome to the workshop!')
