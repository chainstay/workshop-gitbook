## Some Invitations

### Please Ask Questions

Ask them to me, your workshop leader. Ask them on the workshop Slack channel. Ask them to your neighbor, who may have a question for you in return.

### Please Make it Your Own

While this workshop can be done in a linear order, your are welcome to remix it to your heart's content. Find something that interests you? Focus on it for a while, or maybe take it in a new direction.

### Please Provide Feedback

At the bottom of each page, you'll see three feedback buttons. Please click them to provide anonymous feedback about the clarity, informativeness, and relevance of the pages in this workshop. Future students will thank you!

### Please Suggest Improvements

On the top of each page, you'll see an "Edit on GitHub" link. If this doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry about it. However, if you're familiar with Git and Github, please suggest improvements to this workshop, so that future students can learn from your contributions.
