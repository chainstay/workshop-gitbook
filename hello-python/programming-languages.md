# Introducing Python

## Why are we using Python?

Python is a "batteries included" programming language. Unlike other programming languages where you _must_ implement everything yourself, Python makes it easy to jump in and get started. That makes it an ideal programming language to learn with.

Once you become more comfortable with programming, you'll find that Python can do a lot more than teach you programming. For example, Dropbox is built almost entirely using Python.

## How to write Python code

Code is just text. So, any software that allows you to write plain text documents will be perfect for writing Python code.

Here are some suggestions for software you can use to write Python code

{% tab title="Mac or Linux" %}
#### Text editors for Code

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  * You'll also need the [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) \(perpetual free trial\)

Basic text editor _\(Not recommended\)_

* Text Edit \(you must [enable Plain Text mode](https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/textedit-plain-text-mode/)\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Though Text Edit will allow you to write code, it is _far_ more difficult to do so than if you use a text editor well-suited to programming. You will save yourself some heartache if you install a text editor.

{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You _cannot_ write code using rich text editors like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Apache OpenOffice. These applications write text, but not in a way that a computer can read as code.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Once you have a text editor installed, if necessary, and running, you're ready to move on.

You will know that your text editor is ready to go when, by default, `all of the letters have the same width, just like this`
