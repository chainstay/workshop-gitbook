# Checking in

## At this point, you've done a lot

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2812%29.png)

If this was your first time installing Python and running Python code, you have accomplished a lot. You've learned about the underpinnings of the Internet, a new method for interacting with your computer in the `terminal`, and _you've run code_!

There is a lot more that we can do with your web server, but the difficulty is going to ramp up. The next few tasks in this workshop are going to ask you to write a lot of code. If today was your first time writing code, proceeding forward might lead to a lot of frustration as you start to get very cryptic errors.

Consider stopping here, rather than moving forward, and checking out the following resources to get more comfortable with writing code, in general.

* Get more comfortable writing and running Python code from scratch. The exercises at [Learn Python Pogramming](https://pythonbasics.org/) are a great place to start.
* Watch some YouTube videos about fundamental programming concepts e.g. [MIT's Intro to Programming with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytpJdnlu9ug&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA)
* Start working through the perennial programming book: [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

## Ready for more?

If you already had Python installed, or you are already writing code, you may have reached this page pretty quickly.

Give yourself a stretch, crack your knuckles \(if you're into that\), and get ready. Let's see what this little web server can do!
