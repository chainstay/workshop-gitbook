# Experiment with your new language

## Run Python

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Mac" %}
Type the following command and press `enter`

```bash
python3
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
Type the following command and press `enter`

```bash
python3.8
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

You should see:

```text
>>>
```

That means that you can start writing code!

```python
print('hello world')
```

```python
print('hello HackHer413')
```

```python
print(1)
```

```python
print(1 + 1)
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Play, experiment, break stuff!

Or you can assist the hackers sitting next to you until we're ready to move on :\)
{% endhint %}
