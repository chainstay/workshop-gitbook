# Loops

```python
for number in range(5):
    print(number)
```

```python
for letter in "HackHer 413":
    print(letter)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
There's another type of loop, called a `while` loop. We'll get to that one soon...
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
To do something once, write the code.

To do something twice, write the code twice.

To do something thrice, **write the code once and use a loop**.
{% endhint %}
