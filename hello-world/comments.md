# Comments

```python
# I'm a comment

# If you run python code, Python will ignore me

# It's alright though, I'm not lonely because you're reading me!
```

Comments are useful to explain the intention behind your code. Future You is going to love it when Past You writes comments. You are always Past You.

Do Future You a favor :\)
