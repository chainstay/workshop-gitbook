# Integers and Floats

```python
1  # I'm an integer, or an int for short

1.0  # I'm a float
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Use integers unless you _need_ to work with fractional values.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Computers struggle with floats. They do their best, but they struggle.

If your curious, you can learn more here: [https://floating-point-gui.de/](https://floating-point-gui.de/)

It's pretty important, but not at this very moment.
