# Strings

```python
'I am a string'

"I am also a string"

"""I am ALSO A STRING.

I can be on multiple lines!
"""
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Strings are always enclosed by quotes, usually `1` on each side.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you need a string with a `'` within, use `"` to enclose it, and vice-versa. If you need both in the _same_ string, use `"""` on both sides.
{% endhint %}
