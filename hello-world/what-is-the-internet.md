  really?

# The Internet: a Programmer's Definition

## The Internet is a conversation between computers

### For example:

1. Your computer the `client`, asks to read a file on another computer, in a different country
2. That computer, the `server`, responds `OK`, you can read my file. Here it is
3. The `server` sends you the file
4. You receive the file

There you have it. That's the Internet. This happens every single time you go to a website and often when you click things within a web page.
