# What is an Application Server?

## Intro the Application Server

An application server is a web server that runs your code.

Remember that web servers come in all sorts of varieties. They all communicate using `HTTP`, but they might provide very different sorts of `reponse`s . For example, Google's `response` will be a list of search results. Twitter's `response` will be a list of tweets. You'll even find web servers behind the scenes of your smart phone apps. Lyft uses a web server to tell you someone is on their way to drive you to the airport. Spotify uses a web server to stream music to any device.

## Website = Web Server + Your Code

### In review

We know that the internet is made up of _connections_ between _clients_ and _servers._

We know that web servers and clients communicate using `HTTP`.

We know that servers are just code running on computers.

### Our Goal

In this workshop, you will create a web server that takes an `HTTP` `request`, runs your code, then `return`s an `HTTP` `response`.
